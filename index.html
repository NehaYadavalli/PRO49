        <h2>Here are some origami designs.</h2>

        <a href = "http://origami.me/chameleon/"><img src = "chameleon.jpg" ></a>
        <p>Chameleon Origami-this is a versatile one. You can do it however you like. Any color would work, as these lizards change colors!</p>
        <ol>Chameleons come in many sizes and shapes. Make your own custom chameleon!</ol>

        <a href = "http://origami.me/teddy-bear/"><img src = "bear.jpg"></a>
        <p>Bear Origami turns a fierce and dangerous animal into a cute and docile paper creature!</p>
        <ol>Bears are extraordinarily intelligent creatures. They can feel deep emotions, just like humans!</ol>

        <a href = "http://origami.me/panda/"><img src = "panda.jpg"></a>
        <p>Panda Origami is special because all of the black and white papers fold perfectly to symbolize realistic color patterns of an actual panda!</p>
        <ol>Pandas are adorable animals who spend most of their days eating. Bamboo is their main diet!</ol>
